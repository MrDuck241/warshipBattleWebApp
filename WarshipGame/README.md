# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# WarshipGame

**WarshipGame** is an online browser game built using **React** with **Vite** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend. The game enables players to compete in the classic battleship game format, where each player manages their fleet and tries to sink their opponent's ships.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Two 10x10 grids per player â€“ one for positioning ships and another for targeting the opponent.
- **Real-Time Multiplayer**: Communicates with the server via WebSockets for low-latency, real-time gameplay.
- **Environment Configuration**: Server IP and port are specified in the `.env` file.
- **Modern Development Setup**: React + Vite with hot module replacement for fast development.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or newer)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/warship-game.git
cd warship-game

Run the Application

1. Install dependencies:
   npm install
2. Start the development server:
   npm run dev
   The application will run locally, typically at http://localhost:5173.

Run the Server
To start the server, run:
node warshipGameServerFile.js

Production Build and Deployment

1. Build the production version of the application:
   npm run build
   This will generate optimized production-ready static files in the dist/ directory.
2. Deploy the frontend:
   Upload the contents of the dist/ directory to a static file server like Apache, Nginx, or a hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
   Make sure your static file server can handle React routes (e.g., add the necessary configurations for Apache).

Example for Apache:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]

Gameplay
Each player positions their fleet on a 10x10 grid.
Players take turns targeting cells on their opponent's grid.
The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins the game.

Technologies Used

Frontend
React: UI library for building user interfaces.
Vite: Build tool for fast and efficient development.
JavaScript: Programming language for the frontend logic.

Backend
Node.js: Backend runtime for server-side logic.
WebSockets: Real-time communication protocol between the client and server.
